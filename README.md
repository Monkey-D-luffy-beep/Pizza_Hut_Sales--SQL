 Project Highlights
üîç Dataset
I worked with sales data sourced from Kaggle, focusing on exploring and analyzing various aspects of Pizza Hut's business performance.

üõ† Key SQL Concepts Applied

1. Basic Queries
SELECT & WHERE: Retrieved specific data like total orders, revenue, and pizza details.
ORDER BY: Organized and sorted data, such as identifying the most common pizza sizes or highest-priced items.
GROUP BY: Aggregated data by date and pizza categories to calculate metrics like daily averages and category-based quantities.

3. Joins & Subqueries
Combined multiple tables using JOIN to derive insights like total quantities by pizza category or linking orders with revenue data.
Used Subqueries for advanced tasks, such as finding the most-ordered pizza types based on revenue.

5. Window Functions & Ranking
Experimented with RANK() and other window functions to analyze the top-performing pizza types.
Calculated percentage contributions of pizza types to total revenue and ranked them by revenue and category.

7. Advanced Aggregations
Performed cumulative revenue analysis to uncover sales patterns.
Analyzed the distribution of orders by time, revealing insights into peak ordering hours and dominant pizza types during specific periods.

üéØ Key Takeaways
Aggregation Functions: Leveraging GROUP BY and SUM() is critical for trend identification and decision-making.
Real-World Application: This project offered a hands-on experience in applying SQL to analyze real-world business data.

üí° What‚Äôs Next?
I‚Äôm dedicated to refining my SQL skills, diving deeper into advanced data manipulation, and exploring visualization techniques to present insights more effectively.
